# hello-world


I'm Edison Espinosa, and I truly believe that I will change the world. I'm a passionate human being, I'm an all around creative. I have many many ideas on how to improve this world and I just have to get better at executing.

My past includes studying architecture/drafting for four years. Also, Business with a focus in Marketing and Finance, I always tell myself I'm also minoring in Computer Science, but I just say it to be a more well rounded individviual.

I am a lover of life. I live passionately. I have traveled a lot, seen 36 states and so much more.

I currently have finished my first book. Currently working on 3 startups, which I know are going to be groundbreaking and make a positive change in the world. Foxie, Gen-Us, Edison Joao, Colombia Codes, are just some of the projects I'm working on. Aside from a chatbot, and just other things.
I'm also working on my first poetry book.

Over the past 5 months, I've gotten really good at product management, and product design. It's essentially the livelihood of any digital product and the birthplace of it too.

Right now, I'm trying to learn XCode, and the basic to launching the landing page of Gen-Us, I don't want to take the easy way out and I know I will learn all of the require skills, but if someone with some technical knowledge wants to come on board, feel free to reach out.

I guess I've been waiting too long, when the answer was just learning everything myself, because that's what Elon and a bunch of other founders did.


The reason why I'm here today is because I don't have any tech co-founders so I have taken upon myself to build the platforms which I intend to.
I used Github, one time at a hackathon, my first one actually. Which was about 2 years ago almost. OH geez where does the time go?
